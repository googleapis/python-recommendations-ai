                Required. Full resource name of the format:

                IDs by default:

                -  ``shopping_cart``: Predicts items frequently bought
                   together with one or more catalog items in the same
                   shopping session. Commonly displayed after
                   ``add-to-cart`` events, on product detail pages, or
                   on the shopping cart page.

                -  ``home_page``: Predicts the next product that a user
                   will most likely engage with or purchase based on the
                   shopping or viewing history of the specified
                   ``userId`` or ``visitorId``. For example -
                   Recommendations for you.

                -  ``product_detail``: Predicts the next product that a
                   user will most likely engage with or purchase. The
                   prediction is based on the shopping or viewing
                   history of the specified ``userId`` or ``visitorId``
                   and its relevance to a specified ``CatalogItem``.
                   Typically used on product detail pages. For example -
                   More items like this.

                -  ``recently_viewed_default``: Returns up to 75 items
                   recently viewed by the specified ``userId`` or
                   ``visitorId``, most recent ones first. Returns
                   nothing if neither of them has viewed any items yet.
                   For example - Recently viewed.

            user_event (:class:`~.gcr_user_event.UserEvent`):
                Required. Context about the user,
                what they are looking at and what action
                they took to trigger the predict
                request. Note that this user event
                detail won't be ingested to userEvent
                logs. Thus, a separate userEvent write
                request is required for event logging.

            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
