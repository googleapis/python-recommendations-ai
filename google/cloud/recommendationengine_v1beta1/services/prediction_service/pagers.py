    """A pager for iterating through ``predict`` requests.

    This class thinly wraps an initial
    :class:`~.prediction_service.PredictResponse` object, and
    provides an ``__iter__`` method to iterate through its
    ``results`` field.

    If there are more pages, the ``__iter__`` method will make additional
    ``Predict`` requests and continue to iterate
    through the ``results`` field on the
    corresponding responses.

    All the usual :class:`~.prediction_service.PredictResponse`
    attributes are available on the pager. If multiple requests are made, only
    the most recent response is retained, and thus used for attribute lookup.
